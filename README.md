# MCPatcherPatcher++
A resource pack converter from Optifine format to newer and alternative formats. This project uses C++ as the language. This might seem odd in the Minecraft community, but trust me it's cool

# Use
Newly compiled binaries can be found as `linux.out` and `windows.exe`. They may not be stable, and may not contain things from the latest release. I will add releases when I feel it is stable enough.  
Also, I'm not sure what format would be best for linux, as I don't use it very often. If you want you may suggest file types in the [discord](https://discord.gg/waXJDswsaR).  
  
# Build
1. Clone this using `git clone` or Download and Extract the ZIP via Github.  
2. Make sure your current folder is MCPatcherPatcher, if you cloned the repository `cd MCPPPP`.  
3. Build `Source.cpp` in whichever fashion you want, using C++17. (`-fpermissive` is required for g++). Turn on optimizations if possible, the conversion process will be a lot faster.

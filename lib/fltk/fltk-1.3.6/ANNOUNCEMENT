The initial FLTK 1.3.0 is based on the final 1.1.10.

  It adds internationalization, UTF-8 (Unicode), printing support,
  Doxygen based documentation, and several new widgets including
  Fl_Native_File_Chooser, Fl_Table, and Fl_Tree.

FLTK 1.3.6 and previous versions contain many improvements and bug fixes.

  Please see CHANGES for a list of changes in FLTK 1.3.0 to 1.3.6.

  Even though FLTK 1.3.6 does not fix all STRs, we decided to release
  FLTK 1.3.6 as it contains many new features, bug fixes, and adaptations
  to new compiler releases and OS versions (e.g. macOS 10.14 "Mojave"
  up to macOS 11 "Big Sur" and better configure support for some
  Linux platforms).

  Open bugs and feature requests can be viewed (offline) in KNOWN_BUGS.html
  with your browser. Links in this file direct you to the current state
  (online) of all listed bugs and feature requests.

  Note: This file is a snapshot of https://www.fltk.org/roadmap.php
  as of this release (May 15, 2021). Please take into account that some
  bugs and/or feature requests in this list might have been fixed without
  notice.

  Bugs and feature requests for FLTK 1.4.x may also apply to FLTK 1.3.6.

FLTK 1.3.6 is expected to be the last release in the 1.3.x series.

  All bug reports for 1.3.x will be fixed in FLTK 1.4.x if possible.

Note to Git users: This branch (branch-1.3) is end of life since the
release of FLTK 1.3.4. Only very serious bug fixes will be available
if FLTK 1.4.0 is not yet released or not (yet) stable enough.

This release (1.3.6) is a bug fix and maintenance release without new
FLTK features (except macOS Mojave and Big Sur + M1 support).

The current development branch is 'master' -- please checkout a new,
clean working copy if you want to get FLTK 1.4 (master).
